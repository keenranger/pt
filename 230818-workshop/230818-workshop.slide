## For whom?

- Novices to sc(Surface Correlation)
- Those advanced in sc and curious about how it's going to be developed
- Those suspicious of Mark's work

## SC(Surface Correlation)

- Hardware Infra
- Technology
- Software Infra

## SC Infra

- Hardware Infra  
  - Installed *wards*(Bluetooth beacon of TJLABS)
  - Monitored with WMS(Ward Management System)
- Technology
  - Algorithm and written code
  - Maintained with the developer's soul
- Software Infra
  - **RF map**
  - Not quite maintained, even hard to manage

## Contents

With a focus on RF Map...

- What's **go**ing on
- How I'm **go**ing to manage
- **Go** with **Go**

## What's going on

- Uploaded on AWS S3
  - Decouple technology and software infra
  - Compression technique for fast load
  - The lower container size, the faster the boot
  - Will be cached on Redis
- Divided into .csv files from .npy file(no dependencies)
  - .npy file only can be read in Python and a few data language
  - .csv file can be read in Python, Golang, Java...(almost every programming language), even in Excel

## How I'm going to manage

- Divided rssi maps are eaiser to be replaced
- Good developer tool can enhance developer's productivity
- Build, manage, visualize in web

## Go with Go

- Python is very good tool for researchers, but not quite for developers.
- Limitations due to Python e.g., multiprocessing, large container size, even longer code
- Thanks to generalized data, we can migrate to Go

## Summary

RF Map is our foundation; managing it well is our key to success.
